A zero burden plugin that ends Xray-mining forever. This plugin is a minecraft server-side spigot plugin in order to enhance the experience of:
  - Prevent any method of X-Ray mining 100%.
  - Consume theoratically least network traffic and computational effort.
  - Do not affect any normal player
 
This plugin will dynamically generate the ore and stone block that is not connect to the air or water when they get broken. ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/1-0.png) ---> ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/16-0.png) ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/15-0.png) ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/14-0.png) ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/56-0.png)  ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/129-0.png)  ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/73-0.png)  ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/21-0.png)  ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/153-0.png) 
So X-Ray players would think they are getting close to the block. But after they break the last stone. They would find the ores disappear.  ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/56-0.png)  ---> ![](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b98902055/items/1-0.png)

  ### Features : 
  Enhanced mining mechanism : 
    1. Experience : The probability and ore distribution is based on minecraft vanilla settings.
    2. Efficiency : Blocks are generated only when players reveal them. No excessive fake ores transimitted. 
    3. Configurable : All of the ores probability and distribution could be set and revised immediately.
    4. Extendable : Tested on 70 players server, less than 0.1% TPS occupation.

Media Demo:
  - [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WqhJXAGvYQ) : Ore got replaced as X-ray player mining.

### Environment 
This build is compiled and tested on these environments.
* [java] - JVM 1.8
* [spigot] - 1.12.x

### Hard-Dependency
This plugin needs to run with the following plugins with the latest version to work properly:
* none.
----
### Installation
1. Drop the plugin jar file in your server folder /plugins/ and run once.
2. After the plugin folder and default config.yml is generated, stop the server.
3. Start to set your own config withing config.yml.

### Configuration setting
```sh
ENABLED_WORLD: world,world_nether,world_the_end
PROBABILITY_DIAMOND: 0.001
# 0.001 means that when a player mine 1000 blocks, the player would "probably" get 1 diamond. (Expected value.)
MAX_DIAMOND: 4
#What is the maximum number blocks of the ore veins.
PROBABILITY_INCREASING_CONSTANT: 1.0
#You could change this value and hold a mining bonus time!.
#This number will multiply the probability of ore generation.
REPLACING_DIAMOND: true
# true equals replacing such ores.
# false equals leaving such ores as their original position.
#Other ore blocks have default setting. Just follow the logic above.
```
If you don't have any idea how to set the configuration.
Just use the config setting right [here](https://pastebin.com/5xqJGhXn). It is well tuned to match the gaming experience of vanilla minecraft.
